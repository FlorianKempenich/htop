# Htop (rename)

Diagnose what's slowing down your device **Right now!!**

## Why is it cool?

As opposed to iPhones, Android phones are pretty good at maintaining performance over the years.
With the help of ROMs, such as [_Lineage OS_](https://lineageos.org/), and optimisation tools, like 
[_Greenify_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.greenify&hl=en), it is 
easy to keep your device _buttery smooth_ for years and years.

However ... even when everything is optimised ... there is always that one period during the day
when the phone is just slow, or even borderline unresponsive.

> There is always that one period during the day when the phone is borderline unresponsive.

Well, did you know that in 90% of the cases, that sudden slowdown is due to a **single process**
eating away the CPU resources and making the whole OS slow?

This app let you know **which process is guilty for the slowdown**. So you can take actions.

**No more:**
- _"I'll just restart the whole thing"_
- _"I guess I need a new phone"_
- _"Wtf is happening ... I optimized **everything** and it's still slow"_

## How to use

**When you are experiencing a slowdown:**

* Simply launch _Htop_
* Notice who is the culprit
* Take actions
